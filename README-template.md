## My process
 I started by writing the html which was a little bit confusing as a beginner. I then moved on to styling in my CSS stylesheet.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

## Note
This is the very first exercise I have done in HTML/CSS. I started learning front end dev just recently and I am still very inexperienced. I love building stuff with code and I will continue to improve my skill. I gladly accept any help that can be offered ðŸ™‚!
